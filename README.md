### Project Title
The title of this project is "Explore US Bikeshare Data".

### Description
My project is using Python to explore the US bikeshare data. We are focusing on the data in Chicago, New York City and Washington. In my programme, by letting users filter the data in terms of city, month as well as day of week, I will return them with the most common start hour, day of week and month of travel, commonly used stations, average trip duration and counts of user types.

### Files used
Files used in this project are chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv
